<h1>Memory Grove
</h1>
<p>This is a game where you collect memories from the past in an empty, quiet world</p>
<p>Controls:</p>
<p>WASD movement</p>
<p>Space or LMB to inspect memories</p>
<p>In this game, memories are represented by fallen leaves. Also, I really hope ths is close enough to the theme of fall, ended up being closer to emptiness or smth similar.</p>
<p>Tech stack:</p>
<p>First, I implemented basic movement and the tilesets, I later split them into two for layering purposes.</p>
<p>Next, I went on to add functionality to the memories.</p>
<p> After some debugging and minor tweaks to code (If I remember correctly, here I changed to two tilesets), I made the "story" part of the game and (sorry for that being just in one commit)</p>
